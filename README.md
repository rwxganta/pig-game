# Pig Game

This is a simple implementation of the Pig Game, developed as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course project.

## Game Rules

- The game has two players, taking turns to roll a dice.
- Each player can roll the dice as many times as they want on their turn.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score is lost, and it becomes the other player's turn.
- If a player chooses to "Hold," their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.
- The first player to reach a total score of 100 wins the game.
